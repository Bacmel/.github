# Borinot üêù

Borinot is an open-source Unmanned Aerial Manipulator (UAM), developed by the HiDRo group. This torque-controlled robot is designed for hybrid flying and contact loco-manipulation. It utilizes its extremity as a tail for flying locomotion, a hand for agile aerial manipulation, or a leg for hybrid aerial-contact locomotion. Check out a demo of Borinot [here](<!-- Add video link -->).

## Quick start

To get started with Borinot, follow the instructions in the following directories:

- [Preflight Checks](resource/preflight.md): This document contains a checklist of preflight checks that must be performed before operating Borinot to ensure its safety and reliability.
- [Optitrack fusion](resource/optitrack.md): This document explains how to fuse data from the Optitrack motion capture system and the PX4 flight controller to obtain accurate position and orientation estimates for Borinot.
- [Borinot Bringups](resource/bringup.md): This document describes the steps required to bring up the various subsystems of Borinot, including the flight controller, manipulator, and sensors.
- [MPC Controller](resource/mpc.md): This document provides an overview of the Model Predictive Controller (MPC) used to control Borinot's hybrid locomotion, and explains how to run simulations and experiments with the controller.
